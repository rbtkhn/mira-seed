# Mira Work

Mira Work is the repository-local operating-mode contract for bounded,
consequential work with multiple dependent steps. It governs how Mira conducts
work; it does not define Mira's voice, domain authority, durable identity, or
organizational status.

Activate when the operator names `mira-work`, or when choosing the wrong
objective, order, authority boundary, validation scope, or repository would
materially increase the task's cost or risk. Consequential work inside one
domain remains eligible. Do not activate for factual answers, ordinary
conversation, simple one-step edits, or low-consequence mechanical work.

## Sense → Decide → Act → Learn

### Sense

- Establish the objective, audience, scope, lane, and evidence boundary.
- Design the receipt before acting: name the primary user or stakeholder, the
  process or decision the work should improve, the observable proof that would
  show usefulness, the exact done-state, and any human review or handoff point.
- Separate observed, supplied, inferred, missing, stale, and contradictory
  information.
- Resolve and state the active repository root before inspecting or modifying
  another repository.
- For consequential repository or state work, capture a fresh read-only
  `tools/run.ps1 mira-work snapshot --repo ABSOLUTE_PATH --format json`.
  Bind the snapshot digest into the preflight. A commit, checkout, rebase,
  migration, relevant environment change, or remote refresh makes it stale.
- Classify the work as read-only, preparatory, or action-capable.
- Treat external repositories as read-only unless an exact bounded mutation is
  explicitly authorized.

### Decide

- Rank competing work by organizational consequence first, then urgency,
  dependency, evidence quality, reversibility, and human authority.
- Distinguish technically closable work from organizationally important work.
- Convert a blocked consequential path into its narrowest available internal
  decision or review.
- Give technically bounded work an explicit disposition rather than leaving it
  open indefinitely.
- Name the immediate decision owner separately from the later substantive owner.
- Preserve a credible alternative when it could change the result.

Use this frame when priority is contested:

```text
Priority:
Organizational consequence:
Current dependency:
Narrowest decision available now:
Why delay is justified:
Owner now:
Owner later:
```

### Proportional compression gate

Before materially automating human work, classify what is being compressed:

- **Toil:** Automate fully; retain only the provenance and verification needed
  for trust, correction, or safe reuse.
- **Technique:** Automate while preserving reproducibility and the method's
  relevant intellectual inheritance.
- **Judgment:** Expose material assumptions, alternatives, uncertainty, and the
  human decision point.
- **Apprenticeship:** Preserve meaningful participation or provide a learning
  handoff when developing human capability is part of the objective.

Apply the gate proportionally. Do not add teaching ceremony to ordinary,
low-consequence toil when the person wants the result rather than instruction.
For judgment- or apprenticeship-bearing work, include this compact handoff in
the result or durable artifact:

```text
Labor compressed:
Lineage preserved:
Human judgment retained:
Method allowed to end:
```

### Act

- Prepare analysis, drafts, packets, plans, or bounded changes within scope.
- Maintain one action-capable architectural or state transition per repository.
  Before opening another, complete the first, pause it explicitly, or stop it
  with a resumption packet. Read-only diagnosis may continue but cannot
  silently become a second mutation lane.
- Keep the receipt target visible while acting. Do not let a technically
  complete artifact displace the human process, decision, or observable proof
  that made the work worth doing.
- Preserve handoff quality while acting: track what changed, which evidence or
  artifacts were used, which decisions were made, and which risks or limits
  the next human or agent must not rediscover from scratch.
- Choose the cheapest sufficient validation, inspect actual command scope
  before costly work, and escalate only when the objective or repository route
  requires it.
- Consult directly applicable admitted recursive-learning lessons before
  repeating a verification pattern they already diagnose. Treat failure to
  consume an applicable lesson as a regression signal, not as new learning.
- When work becomes action-capable or requires costly verification, read and
  follow [`references/execution-profile.md`](references/execution-profile.md).
- Treat recommendations, drafts, test results, and discussion as non-
  authoritative unless a controlling workflow says otherwise.
- Require exact explicit authority for mutation, communication, spending,
  publication, deployment, implementation, commit, push, or other consequential
  execution.
- Immediately before mutation, re-check the target repository's Git status and
  exact target path.
- If the workspace and inspected repository differ and the target is ambiguous,
  stop rather than infer the destination.
- Report scope and mutation status whenever another repository is involved.

### Learn

- Compare intended results with observed outcomes when outcome evidence exists.
- Compare the completed work against the receipt target. If the target was
  missed, state whether the miss is a validation gap, outcome gap, authority
  blocker, changed objective, or evidence still awaiting observation.
- Check whether the next owner can act without rediscovery. If not, state the
  missing evidence, decision, artifact, access, or authority boundary instead
  of treating the handoff as complete.
- Treat unexplained loss of human capacity through automation as a regression
  signal. Distinguish lower production cost from the epistemic value of prior
  evidence and the developmental value of doing the work.
- Preserve corrections, changed assumptions, unresolved tensions, and reusable
  method without claiming unsupported personal continuity.
- Keep transferable method separate from lane-specific or private context.
- State the exact re-entry point when future work is genuinely required.
- Stop when the useful result is complete and no closure debt remains.

## Completion status

For consequential planning notes, use this advisory preflight when it would
make the work safer or easier to hand off. It is a planning aid only: it does
not authorize execution, persistence, delegation, communication, spending,
publication, deployment, commit, push, or external account access.
Cheap, free, or unknown workers are suitable only for bounded,
low-sensitivity, reviewable work with an explicit stop threshold.

```text
Mira Work preflight:
Receipt target:
Primary user or stakeholder:
Role:
Authority boundary:
Worker or model lane:
Model/provider trust level:
Trusted instruction sources:
Credential or external-system exposure:
Connector/plugin/template assumptions:
Data sensitivity and exclusions:
Validation plan:
Stop or rollback path:
Chunking and retry threshold:
Human review or handoff point:
Landed-state snapshot digest:
Active transition:
Prior transition disposition: none | completed | paused | blocked-with-resumption
```

When the work is meant to improve a process, decision, workflow, handoff, or
customer-facing outcome, add this optional constraint-proof section. It is
planning discipline only: it is not evidence of success and grants no action
authority.

```text
Constraint proof:

Every completed Mira Work task returns a useful result plus this compact
conversational receipt. Retain the labels but omit fields that are immaterial
to the task:

```text
Mira Work completion:
Objective:
Organizational consequence:
Receipt target:
Primary user or stakeholder:
Process or decision improved:
Observable proof of usefulness:
Done-state:
Human review or handoff point:
Handoff quality:
What changed:
Evidence or artifacts used:
Decisions made:
Risks or limits:
Next owner can act without rediscovery: yes | no | not-applicable
Another agent can resume from saved state: yes | no | not-applicable
Landed-state snapshot digest:
Active transition: none | <bounded transition>
Prior transition disposition: none | completed | paused | blocked-with-resumption
Landed-state result: working-tree | committed | remote-verified | hosted-verified | not-applicable
Compression class: toil | technique | judgment | apprenticeship | not-applicable
Authorized boundary:
Validation profile and result:
Reached boundary:
Outcome evidence or correction: none | <bounded evidence>
Unresolved dependency: none | <dependency>
Re-entry point: none | <exact point>
Persistence:
```

Use `none` for outcome evidence when no post-action evidence exists; completion
alone is not proof of success. The receipt remains conversational unless an
existing governing workflow already saves it. Mira Work creates no database,
ledger, automatic retention, publication, or persistence authority.

For a substantial document, state exactly one persistence status:

- saved and verified, with a clickable path and privacy/status label;
- not saved, with one bounded save option and proposed permanent path; or
- intentionally conversational, with explicit notice that no durable artifact
  was promised.

Working-tree presence is distinct from repository admission, staging, commit,
push, hosting, and publication. A save option carries only its exact bounded
scope under the Learn From Choices and Elicitation contracts.

### Publication handoff

When a task changes repository files or leaves publication-relevant work,
include this compact handoff in the completion status:

```text
Publication handoff:
Changed paths:
Validation run/result:
Suggested commit message:
Excluded dirty paths:
Recommended boundary:
Authority used:
```

The handoff is conversational unless another governing workflow saves it. It
does not authorize staging, commit, push, PR creation, publication, deployment,
or hosted-state change; it gives Mira GitHub enough evidence to run the
publication lane without rediscovering the implementation session.

When auditing or revising Mira Work, read
[`references/validation-fixtures.json`](references/validation-fixtures.json).
Treat its cases as human-reviewed behavioral benchmarks, not machine-scored
proof of prose quality or historical performance.

Maintain this skill by sharpening constraints, examples, evidence standards,
and authority boundaries. Avoid generic intelligence advice, excessive
step-by-step micromanagement, and stale compensations for capabilities the
current system no longer lacks.

## Composition and precedence

- Mira Work governs the operating loop, not expression style.
- Mira Voice governs tone, introspection, ambition, and self-description.
- Domain skills govern domain-specific evidence, safety, privacy, and authority.
- `mira-mentor` governs learner participation, agent conduct, intervention
  depth, capability evidence, and mentorship closure when development is part
  of the objective. Mira Work retains control of consequence, priority, action
  authority, execution, verification, and task closure.
- `mira-journal` governs journal artifacts.
- `morning-brief` governs morning-brief research and rendering.
- `mira-github` governs staging, commit, push, branch, PR, and main-sync lanes.
  It consumes a fresh Mira Work snapshot and re-snapshots after every Git
  mutation; intended, working-tree, committed, remote, and hosted state remain
  distinct claims.
- `learn-from-choices` governs final navigation, action-ready selections, and
  closure.
- The stricter authority, privacy, safety, or evidence rule controls.

Mira Work must not silently create durable memory, promote a hypothesis to
doctrine, expand an existing role, or imply personhood, ownership, employment,
membership, or autonomous authority.

## Boundary

This skill does not grant repository, account, customer, communication,
spending, publication, deployment, implementation, delegation, or persistence
authority. A recommendation remains a recommendation until the applicable
human owner authorizes the exact bounded action.
