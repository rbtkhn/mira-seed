# Audit Routing

This note defines how repository-level, archive-domain, and skill-contract
audits compose in Mira Core. It is a routing control, not a replacement
for any auditor's governing skill.

## Authority Model

`repo-audit` is the coordinating system auditor. It establishes repository
scope, visibility ceilings, validation planes, evidence classes, and the
repository-level implications of domain findings.

`archive-audit` is authoritative for landed archive health: manifest parity,
coverage, density, routing, duplicates, structural validity, and repair
candidates. It does not adjudicate source truth, repository architecture, or
skill quality.

`skill-audit` is authoritative for skill-contract quality: trigger clarity,
workflow completeness, authority boundaries, progressive disclosure,
testability, drift risk, benchmarkability, and revision readiness. It does not
replace archive validation or decide source truth.

## Choreography

1. Start with `repo-audit` when the question concerns repository readiness,
   coherence, reproducibility, governance, or cross-system integration.
2. Delegate explicit archive questions to `archive-audit`.
3. Delegate explicit instruction-surface questions to `skill-audit`.
4. Preserve each domain auditor's findings, identifiers, severity, scope, and
   provenance. Do not duplicate or launder domain findings into a new severity.
5. Evaluate repository-level implications separately, including integration,
   documentation, validation-plane, and hosted-state consequences.
6. Route repairs through the owning workflow: `archive-repair` for archive
   defects, skill-document changes plus focused tests for skill defects, and
   repository code, controls, or documentation repair for system defects.
7. Keep truth adjudication outside this trio. Invoke `reality-check` only when
   claim verification or lattice adjudication is explicitly in scope.

## Prior and third-party audit intake

A prior audit, consultant report, model-generated critique, or returned Grok
report is an input artifact rather than repository evidence by itself. Record
its author or engine, revision window, capture date, direct references, and
missing evidence. Reproduce material claims against the current declared
repository state before importing them as findings.

For returned Grok reports in Mira Core, use `grok-research` in report or
adversarial-review mode to assess provenance, source quality, unsupported
certainty, and direct-link availability. Then let `repo-audit` assess only the
repository-system implications. Preserve operator dispositions separately:
acceptance or rejection of a recommendation does not adjudicate the underlying
factual condition.

When repository state has advanced, reconcile every imported finding as
`open`, `resolved`, `superseded`, `rejected-by-operator`, `not-reproduced`, or
`unavailable`. Bind that disposition to the exact commit, index, working tree,
side worktree, or hosted state checked.

## Decision Tree

Ask what object is being evaluated:

- Repository system, controls, validation, dependencies, governance, or
  integration: use `repo-audit`.
- Landed sources, manifests, archive coverage, density, routing, duplicates,
  or structural health: use `archive-audit`.
- Skill trigger, instructions, authority boundary, testability, drift, or
  revision readiness: use `skill-audit`.
- Source or lattice claim truth: use `reality-check`; do not force it through
  the three-audit choreography.

When more than one object is in scope, use `repo-audit` as the outer frame and
invoke the relevant domain auditors with explicit, bounded scopes. The outer
audit records the domain results and assesses only their repository-system
consequences.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not make `repo-audit` repeat archive-domain rules.
- Do not use `archive-audit` to judge whether a source claim is true.
- Do not use `skill-audit` to infer repository health from prose alone.
- Do not treat a passing domain audit as proof that hosted-state or
  change-time controls operate.
- Do not infer repair, staging, commit, publication, or deployment authority
  from any audit finding.

## Minimal Handoff Record

Every composed audit should record:

- repository root and revision or observed-state identifier;
- mode, scope, exclusions, and visibility ceiling;
- domain auditor and exact bounded scope;
- command or deterministic check executed;
- domain result with original provenance;
- repository-level implication, if any;
- repair owner and separate authority status.
- prior-finding lifecycle disposition and checked state, when applicable;
- repair benefit, effort, dependencies, readiness, and required authority when
  prioritization was requested.

Authority effect: none. This routing note grants no authority to modify,
repair, stage, commit, push, publish, deploy, communicate, or alter hosted
settings.
