# Geo-Strategy

Use after intake has landed or when deepening an existing retrospective run.
This skill turns source material into bounded strategic judgment; it does not
provide operational advice or independently verify public facts.

## Strategic Promise

- archive-backed strategic analysis;
- bounded crisis-object and mechanism judgment;
- actor incentive and constraint mapping;
- forecast and watch implications;
- decision-relevant uncertainty compression.

Do not use this skill to assign military tasks, resolve forecasts, publish,
communicate externally, browse automatically, or perform reality adjudication.

## Core Law

Read in this order:

```text
archive -> voices/channels -> work/daily
```

This skill does not replace `archive-intake` and never creates a daily directory
for a date without manifest rows.

## Sustainable Cadence

Compose with
[`narrative-geopolitics/method/sustainable-cadence.md`](../../../narrative-geopolitics/method/sustainable-cadence.md)
when daily workload is in view. The default daily invariant is `15 minutes` of
capture-only source continuity, not a daily packet. Transcript capture is toil;
archive intake is governed source truth; synthesis is judgment.

Do not treat a missed day, a captured-only day, or an unlanded transcript queue
as a mandate to manufacture `geo-strategy`. Full packets are twice-weekly by
default or threshold-driven when landed material creates a substantive delta.
Missed capture days route to weekly catch-up.

## Daily Contract

Canonical:

- `sources.md`
- `synthesis.md`
- `forecast.md`
- `daily-brief.md`

Generated after the canonical files are issue-ready:

- `issue.md`

Generated only by a separate live-research experiment when explicitly requested:

- `narrative-geopolitics/work/morning-brief/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

There is no tracked session receipt or placeholder-day state.

## Entrypoint

```powershell
.\tools\run.ps1 synthesis --date YYYY-MM-DD
.\tools\run.ps1 synthesis --date YYYY-MM-DD --execute
```

Month and range modes process only dates with manifest rows. The deprecated
`--scaffold-empty` flag reports skipped dates and writes nothing.

## Choice Acceleration Policy

Use a geo-strategy option engine for follow-up menus after an archive-backed
issue, day, or crisis object is in view. The visible user surface remains
exactly four `A`-`D` options, but those options are selected from a larger
internal library of 10-20 next-best epistemic moves. Optimize for faster
judgment formation, not faster prose: every visible option must improve
evidence, mechanism clarity, uncertainty handling, forecast leverage, or an
explicit hold.

Rank candidate moves in this order:

1. crisis consequence;
2. evidence gap;
3. verification need;
4. forecast leverage;
5. decision readiness.

Prefer a concrete next workflow over generic continuation language. Do not
surface vague `continue`, `deepen`, or `explore more` options unless the label
names the exact object and the missing judgment job. If all four options would
be navigation-only, collapse the surface to the narrowest concrete workflow
available now and state the blocked action.

Internal move library:

- intake coverage audit;
- same-object voice comparison;
- mechanism spine extraction;
- competing mechanism test;
- operational-claim triage;
- reality-check handoff;
- original-language source search;
- forecast-hook extraction;
- counterevidence pass;
- actor constraint map;
- escalation ladder map;
- decision implication compression;
- public-use boundary;
- daily packet build;
- verification packet draft;
- pause/hold with explicit unresolved gate.

Project the selected moves onto the four-option visible surface this way:

- `A` highest-confidence next action;
- `B` correction, coverage repair, or missing-foundation action;
- `C` deepening move with the best judgment leverage;
- `D` alternate object, explicit hold, verification/publication boundary, or
  packet-disposition move.

Compose with `learn-from-choices` without weakening it. Generic final-response
controls remain `learning_eligibility: none`. Only action-ready options whose
visible label begins with an executable verb may carry selection authority.
`Stage`, `Commit`, `Push`, `Publish`, `Deploy`, `Send`, canonical verification
admission, and external communication require direct explicit operator
commands. This policy does not grant authority to browse, create verification
packets, admit `OPC-*`/`CLM-*`/`NG-*` records, publish, or assign operational
truth.

Use the Aug. 18, 2026 Iran-Hormuz issue as the first live calibration case for
this policy: when operational claims control public factual use, route factual
adjudication through external-knowledge `reality-check` rather than treating
archive testimony as verified fact.

## Guided Menu

The legacy five-option menu is deprecated. For new geo-strategy work, apply the
Choice Acceleration Policy and return exactly four `A`-`D` options.

## Density Triage

After validation and before deepening, use archive density as a review guide.
The guided menu and cadence startup may surface archive-audit benchmark
advisories directly. When more detail is needed, run a range or day check:

```powershell
.\tools\run.ps1 archive-audit --start-date YYYY-MM-DD --end-date YYYY-MM-DD --format markdown
```

For dense or voice-heavy days, optionally surface same-day multi-channel
triangulation candidates:

```powershell
.\tools\run.ps1 triangulation-candidates --start-date YYYY-MM-DD --end-date YYYY-MM-DD --format markdown
```

Use the output as an advisory prompt to compare invariant voice claims against
host pressure fields. It is not evidence, verification, a mandatory synthesis
gate, or a routing repair signal.

## Current-Day Issue Scan

Before answering an issue-focused question after multiple same-day intakes,
scan the full manifest-backed source set for that date unless the operator
explicitly narrows the scope. This applies to prompts such as `focus on X`,
`what did [voice] say`, `check all today's transcripts`, and issue questions
that arrive after fresh intake has landed for the date.

Use:

```powershell
.\tools\run.ps1 source-topic-scan --date YYYY-MM-DD --query "topic terms" --format markdown
```

Treat the scan as retrieval coverage only. It does not verify claims, promote
issue membership, create a daily synthesis, or override source judgment.

Use [archive audit and density](../../../narrative-geopolitics/method/archive-density.md)
rules this way:

- thin days: check overclaim risk, hook necessity, and caveat language;
- dense days: check voice triangulation, same-day multi-channel candidates,
  issue selection, and held-story logic;
- `very_dense` overlay days: treat dense-day review as mandatory before
  deepening;
- `OPC-*` days: prioritize verification review, but do not assign operational truth;
- carried-hook days: avoid duplicate forecasts unless a new wager is genuinely created.
- provisional routing warnings: treat as landing-time enrichment debt unless a
  separate repair-candidate warning is present.
- repair-candidate warnings: favor reconciliation before deepening.

## Source-Anchor Coverage

Use a variable source-anchor target rather than a hard 40-anchor minimum:

- require at least one valid `SRC-*` anchor for every landed source included in
  the Run Source Set;
- target 2–3 anchors per major mechanism or theme;
- treat approximately 24–30 anchors as a normal full-day working ceiling unless
  the material supports more distinct, non-redundant points;
- use 40 anchors only for unusually dense or multi-theater batches, and only
  when each additional anchor has a distinct analytic job.

Anchors support source traceability; they do not independently corroborate a
claim or convert source assertion into reality-check evidence.

The daily-run validator performs advisory checks for minimum source coverage,
partial quote coverage, repeated load-bearing quotes, and unusually high anchor
counts. These checks warn for review; they do not replace source judgment or
block a justified dense-batch exception.

## Guardrails

- Require exact manifest coverage in the Intake Batch before synthesis.
- Permit a documented Run Source Set subset.
- Treat retrospective forecasts as retrospective unless timing proves otherwise.
- For a newly created retrospective packet, require a completed
  `Synthesis contract: delta-v1` Distinctive Contribution: comparison window,
  new mechanism/evidence/contradiction, and disposition. If there is no
  substantive delta, keep the intake archive-only and do not create a daily
  packet.
- Keep `daily-brief.md` internal until intentionally promoted.
- Treat `morning-brief` as a local, opt-in current-signal experiment with a
  frozen research receipt. It may compare provisional observations with recent
  judgments and accountable open forecasts, but it does not revise this daily
  contract, create a daily synthesis, or require a manifest batch for the brief
  date.
- Keep `issue.md` internal reader-facing; generation is not publication.
- Declare issue membership in the synthesis `Issue Story Desk`; require matching `Issue Copy` in `daily-brief.md` and regenerate rather than hand-editing `issue.md`.
- Do not revive the old `public-brief.md` contract.
- Do not alter private intake behavior.
- Do not browse, create verification packets, or assign operational truth automatically.
- Print an explicit packet-request command for `request` rows; operator action remains required.
- Permit bounded internal synthesis with unresolved claims. Block high-consequence public factual use and accountable forecast resolution until packet requirements are met.
- Reject orphan `OPC-*` rows: every retained claim must control planned public factual use, watch promotion, or a forecast dependency.
